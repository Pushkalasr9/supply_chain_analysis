I. Impact of Supply Chain Visibility Tool on Lead Times 
Null Hypothesis (H0): 
There is no significant reduction in lead times after implementing the supply 
chain visibility tool. 
In simpler terms, the null hypothesis suggests that any observed changes in lead 
times after implementing the supply chain visibility tool are not statistically 
significant. In other words, the tool does not have a meaningful impact on 
reducing lead times. 
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): 
There is a significant reduction in lead times after implementing the supply chain 
visibility tool. 
The alternative hypothesis proposes the opposite — it asserts that there is a 
meaningful and statistically significant reduction in lead times resulting from the 
implementation of the supply chain visibility tool.
